# Invictus-Warehouse-Direct
In the dynamic landscape of e-commerce and inventory management, the need for seamless and comprehensive data
application has never been more crucial. The "Invictus Warehouse Direct" project addresses this demand by combining
operational and analytical functionalities to streamline customer transactions and empower sales executives with valuable 
insights. At its core, the system serves as an operational database, facilitating customer interactions with the warehouse.
through a user-friendly web portal.<br>
In parallel, the application offers a dedicated portal for sales executives, providing them with a comprehensive suite of
analytical tools. This dual-purpose approach empowers executives to make data-driven decisions, contributing to effective
inventory management and strategic business planning. The goal is to enhance operational efficiency by identifying
underperforming warehouses with excess stock. By pinpointing such warehouses, my aim is to strategically close them and
seamlessly transfer their stock to more suitable warehouses. <br>

To initiate the application, open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the file named ‘Invictus warehouse direct app.ipynb’. 
This main file manages the entire project’s execution. Code corresponding to each GUI page is organized within this file, 
differentiated by appropriate headings. Various classes and functions have been created for different pages, and they are 
invoked as needed. <br>

The imported dataset is related to a fictional company, a retailer of classic model cars, and other vehicles, which stores the 
vehicles in four different warehouses. <br>

<h3>Objective:</h3>
The objective of this project is to utilize MySQL Workbench to examine the data model and identify crucial aspects of the 
data that can inform strategic decisions on reorganizing or reducing inventory while maintaining timely service to customers. 
Specific queries will be developed to address key questions, including the relationship between inventory numbers and sales 
figures, and the identification of slow-moving items that could be potential candidates for removal from the product line. 
The goal is to provide the company with insightful and data-driven recommendations for inventory reduction, ultimately 
supporting the decision-making process in closing one of their storage facilities. <br>

<h4>Application Design:</h4>
